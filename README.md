XPGuardian
==========
A simple Bukkit plugin for controlling when and whether or not a player keeps XP on death, based on permission nodes.

Configuration
-------------
There is none. Keeping it simple. But there might be some in the future. Maybe.

Permissions
-----------
* **xpguardian.pve:** Keeps XP on death when a player is killed by PvE means (i.e. a mob).
* **xpguardian.pve:** Keeps XP on death when a player is killed by another player.
* **xpguardian.*:** Inherits both of the nodes above.
